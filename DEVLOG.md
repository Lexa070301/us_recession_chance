### Implemented (PLAN.md Phases 1–4 done, 5–7 partial)

- **Config layer**: `config/sources.yaml` (28 FRED series), `signals.yaml`
  (20 signals incl. nowcast block), `channels.yaml`, `model.yaml`
  (probit coefs, composite bands, plan gating), `locales/{en,ru}.yaml`.
  Zod schemas + loader with env-resolved channel chat_ids.
- **Data layer**: `db.ts` (better-sqlite3, embedded migrations), repositories
  (observations, signal_state/events, composite_snapshots, users, prefs,
  subscriptions, payments, deliveries-outbox), `fredClient.ts` (rate limit,
  retries, incremental fetch, `vintage_dates` support), `nber.ts`.
- **Signal engine**: transforms on native frequency (no ffill-to-daily),
  typed evaluators (levels, episode_duration, streak, rise_from_trough,
  change_over_period, yoy, any_of/all_of), deterministic recompute +
  transition-only events (dedupe), hysteresis (exit_below/exit_periods).
- **Composite**: weighted score (watch .5 / warning 1 / critical 1.5) →
  prob bands from model.yaml → `composite_snapshots`.
- **Publisher**: canonical event → per-locale render → outbox deliveries
  with retries; DM filtering by prefs/plan; 403 → is_blocked.
- **Bot** (grammY): /start /status /signals /settings /lang /plan,
  inline keyboards, Stars payments (XTR invoice → activate subscription,
  expiry job + downgrade), free/plus gating.
- **Jobs**: node-cron scheduler (daily/weekly/monthly fetches, digest,
  delivery retries, sub expiry); CLIs: backfill, check-signals, send-test.
- `index.ts` modes: `bot` | `scheduler` | `all`.
- Tests: 15 vitest cases (evaluators + engine dedup/transitions).
  `npm run typecheck` clean.

### Design notes / deviations from plan

- Evaluators are pure functions of full series history — no fragile
  incremental state; `episode` inferred by walking the trailing run.
- `signal_state.last_obs_date` gates re-evaluation (publication-lag aware).
- Deliveries unified in `deliveries` table for channels + DMs (outbox).
- Fixed during smoke test: duplicated transition label, missing `since`
  in event context; `.gitignore` `data/` → `/data/` (was blocking src/data).

### TODO / known gaps

- Phase 5: `backtest.ts`, `fitModel.ts` not implemented; prob bands are
  static config values pending calibration.
- Stars payments: code complete, needs Telegram test-env e2e check;
  recurring invoices are manual-renewal for now.
- No release-calendar awareness (fixed fetch days instead).
- X adapter, web dashboard, admin commands — not started.

### Repository initialized

- Node.js/TypeScript scaffold: ESM, NodeNext, tsx dev runs, vitest, strict TS.
- Deps: `better-sqlite3`, `grammy`, `node-cron`, `yaml`, `zod`, `i18next`, `dotenv`.
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore` (env, data/, dist/), `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`.

### Research summary (pre-code)

- Indicator list validated against Fed research (Richmond Fed EB 19-12,
  FEDS Notes on probit models & OOS performance, SF Fed Letter 2022-36,
  NY Fed yield-curve model). Corrections applied:
  - `JTSQUR` = quits rate, `JTSLDL` = layoffs/discharges (was swapped in draft).
  - ISM PMI and Conference Board LEI are not free via FRED — use OECD `USSLIND`
    and regional Fed surveys as proxies.
  - Added `TEMPHELPS`, `CCSA`, `T10Y2Y`, `RECPROUSM156N`, `BAMLC0A4CBBB`
    as candidates.
- fed_monitor (github.com/realwaynesun/fed_monitor, MIT) chosen as the
  architectural spec to port to Node/TS. Notable upstream bugs to fix:
  `make_alert_id` uses process-randomized `hash()` (breaks state dedupe across
  runs), no episode dedup / hysteresis, monthly series ffilled to daily hides
  publication lag, upserts destroy ALFRED vintages.
- Existing competitors: RecessionPulse, usrecession.watch, FRED email alerts.
  Differentiation: per-user thresholds, multilanguage channels, honest
  per-signal history stats, Telegram-native subscriptions.

See PLAN.md for the implementation roadmap.
